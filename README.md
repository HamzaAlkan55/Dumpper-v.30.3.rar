What is Dumpper?

Dumpper is a free and portable software for Windows designed to manage wireless networks and recover Wi-Fi passwords. It is mainly used for:

Scanning nearby wireless networks

Displaying saved Wi-Fi passwords stored on your system

Attempting to connect to vulnerable networks using WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)

Working alongside tools like JumpStart to test router security

It is often used in network security assessments but should only be used on networks you own or have permission to test.
